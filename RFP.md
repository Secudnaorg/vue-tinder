## Who ?

The startup Gottaphish, whose president is Thibault Daccord, is in charge of this project. Through this project, it aims to train its employees and individuals interactively and raise awareness of the dangers of phishing in a fun way. To achieve this, the project is based on the existing Vue-Tinder application and aims to modify it in the form of a quiz.

## What ?

The subject of this project is phishing, which is a fraud where the perpetrator pretends to be a familiar organization using its logo and name to trick people into providing sensitive information such as passwords or bank card numbers.

In recent years, phishing emails have become increasingly sophisticated and can be hyper-personalized, making them difficult to detect.

Phishing remains the cyber attack that poses the greatest threat to individuals and businesses. In the third quarter of 2022, according to the cybersecurity company Vade Secure, 203.9 million phishing emails were sent, compared to 155.3 million in the previous quarter.

On the business side, several consequences of phishing can be listed:

- Loss of sensitive data
- Financial damages
- Decreased productivity
- Damaged reputation
- Disruption of the supply chain

## Where ?

This issue is global in scale and affects various industries. The most impacted sectors are:

- Finance:
  Malicious actors can gain access to financial benefits from companies operating in the banking, email, social media, and telephone sectors.
- Technology and telecommunications:
  Cybercriminals can intercept emails and SMS messages used to verify a user's identity through two-factor authentication. Therefore, these phishing attempts can also lead to the compromise of other accounts.
  Furthermore, several well-known brands are commonly impersonated in this cyberattack. At the top of the list, we find:

      - PayPal
      - Microsoft
      - DHL
      - Facebook
      - Amazon
      - Apple
      - eBay Inc.

## When ?

Phishing is a cyberattack that has been around since the mid-1990s. It originated when a group of young individuals created a chat room feature on AOL, where they posed as AOL administrators. They stole credit card numbers from other users to ensure they would always have free access to AOL.

## How ?

Phishing can take on several forms of attack. The primary method used by fraudsters is through email, but it can also come in the form of fraudulent SMS messages and phone calls aimed at collecting sensitive data from targets of these attacks.

In each of these attack methods, the fraudster poses as a known entity, such as a bank or tax service, or even a brand, and lures you into clicking on a link that takes you to a web page asking for your sensitive information.

To address this issue, we will be implementing a fun quiz application that will allow users to learn about this cyberattack by identifying fraudulent emails from genuine ones.

## How much ?

## Why ?

The rationale behind the implementation of this initiative is the staggering magnitude that phishing has assumed over the last few years, particularly the increasing difficulty in distinguishing between fraudulent and legitimate emails. The goal of this endeavor is to sensitize individuals to the perils associated with this predicament. In so doing, the aim is to counteract the annual escalation in the number of received attacks by decreasing this metric.
